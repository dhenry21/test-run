Just trying something new out today
I'm building code thinking the world is watching, but as you get older, you realize, nobody was paying any attention and it was ok to learn, fail, and get better.
The only person you need to compare yourself to is who you were yesterday
Be better than that person
But be gentle to yourself if you weren't
